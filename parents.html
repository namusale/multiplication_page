        <h4>To My Fellow Parent or Guardian</h4>
        <br><br>
        Thank for taking time to visit this webpage.
        Im of the view that your child's mastery of maths specifically multiplication tables is of importance to you.<br><br>

        This webpage covers the following:<br><br>
        <ul>
            <li>Counting in numbers which begins in Year 1. A child counting in 2s is laying the foundation of mastery of multiplication table of 2. 
                The page gives an opportunity to count in numbers from 1 to 12. The webpage also provides for learning and also practising by answering questions for each table.</li><br><br><br>
            <li>Another aspect addressed in the pages is actual mastery of Times Table. To help child acquire thos skill, the following steps have been followed:<br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>A list of Times Table facts have been provided in case the student needs some help with recall.</li><br><br>
                    <li>Provision to answer questions in each table has been given with every answer checked for correctness</li><br><br>
                    <li>After a child has mastered the tables,quick fire questions are given. These are timed at 6 seconds (like Year 4 Multiplication tabel test) and answers
                        are check for correctness as usual.</li><br><br>
                </ul>
            </li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <br><br>This content is as a result of 6 years of following the learning journey of my children in primary school years. Im by no means a teacher but a parent,like many other 
        parents, learning as their children learn. I hope you find this content useful <br>
<br>
Thank you <br><br>
